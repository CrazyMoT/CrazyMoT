I have nearly four years of experience in backend development with Python, having
worked on projects in green energy and crypto startups. I am driven by a passion for
continuous learning and solving increasingly complex challenges. My key interest lies
in designing and optimising high-load, scalable systems that enhance performance
and reliability. I thrive in teams that foster openness, collaboration, and a strong sense
of mutual support, where knowledge-sharing and collective problem-solving are at the
heart of success.
